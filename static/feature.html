    <h2>Facial Feature Detection</h2>
    <p>Luxand FaceSDK employs sophisticated algorithms to detect and track facial features quickly and reliably. The SDK returns the coordinates of 70 facial feature points including eyes, eye contours, eyebrows, lip contours, nose tip, and so on. The detection works in real-time on desktop and mobile, which allows performing smooth real-time tracking and transformations of facial features in live video. On desktop platforms, FaceSDK delivers true 60-fps performance on video streams, while video processing on mobile platforms such as Apple iPhone 6 is performed at 30 fps in landscape orientation (and in all orientations on devices with more powerful platforms). The feature enables building applications adding new elements such as mustaches, eyeglasses or wigs; face morphing and augmented reality. By using FaceSDK, we built Mirror Reality SDK that transforms faces in real time by detecting facial features in a video stream. Another great example is a baby generator, which morphs faces of two partners to predict what their baby will look like. Developers can implement mechanisms to analyze faces detecting emotions or rotation angle. Morph, animate, or transform human faces with the SDK!</p><br>

        <h3>Detect Human Facial Feature</h3>
        <p>Luxand’s patent pending technology detects facial features quickly and reliably. The SDK processes an image, detects human faces within it, and returns the coordinates of 70 facial feature points including eyes, eye contours, eyebrows, lip contours, nose tip, and so on.

        <h4>Create 3D model</h4>
        <p>Developing morphing, animation, or 3D software? Create a perfect 'skin' or a 3D head model automatically! The SDK can detect human faces and return the coordinates of facial features, making it easy to match facial features in the photograph with corresponding features on the 3D head.</p><br>

        <h4>Make Animated 3D Avatars Completely Automatically</h4>
        <p>Make a perfect 'talking head' avatar for your online applications with a single photograph of a human face. Current generations of 3D head modeling software require manual selection of major facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth to match them against the same features on the 3D head model. The manual intervention is required to create realistic 3D heads, and is an absolute must if you want animation.

            The SDK automates the task, allowing you to make new avatars on the fly. Imagine letting your customers upload their pictures and immediately receive their animated avatars! The SDK recognizes the face in a photograph and returns the coordinates of facial features in a list of anchor points. Your software can easily match facial features such as eyes, mouth, nose, and ears to the points on your 3D head model, creating a head that looks and moves like the original.</p><br>
